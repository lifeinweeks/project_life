    <h1>What is This ?</h1>
    <p>A Fun structure of working hard to achieve my goals.</p>

    <h1>how does it work</h1>
    <p>The way i wanna structure my life:</p>
    <p>Phase 1(duration is not fixed): I work my hardest pushing my limits.</p>
    <p>Phase 2(3 days At most/maybe more in extreme cases): I do whatever whenever, Zero plans, just fucking around.</p>
    <p>Each Phase 1 has a theme, I get inspiration from that theme structuring phase 1 based on that theme.</p>

    <h1>Current Theme:</h1>
    <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Herakles/labors.html">The Labors of Hercules</a>
    <p>Herakles's dad cheats on his wife ==> the wife gets angry and so take it on the kids (ofc) ==> she curses him with temporary insanity ==> Herakles kills his own wife and children ==> wakes up from unsanity ==> realizes he fucked up and asks appolo for guidance ==> gets told he will serve 12 years doing 12 super hard quests.</p>
